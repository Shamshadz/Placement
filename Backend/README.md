Backend — organizing backend material

Purpose
- Store framework-specific guides, small projects, snippets, and interview questions related to backend development.

Suggested subfolders
- notes/          — architecture notes, patterns, and cheatsheets
- projects/       — small services or sample APIs
- snippets/       — useful code snippets (DB access, auth, caching)
- tests/          — short test harnesses or load-test scripts

Per-framework subfolders (examples)
- `Java Backend/Spring/`
- `JavaScript Backend/Nestjs/`
- `Python Backend/Django/`

Quick checklist
- Add `README.md` in each project subfolder with run/setup steps.
- Keep sensitive credentials out of the repo; use `.env.example` for placeholders.
