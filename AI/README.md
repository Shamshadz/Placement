AI / ML — what to store here

Purpose
- Place notebooks, lecture notes, short projects, and PDFs related to AI and ML.

Suggested subfolders
- notes/       — markdown summaries and cheat-sheets
- pdfs/        — research papers and slides
- projects/    — small demos and experiment code
- datasets/    — very small sample data (large sets should use external storage)

How to use
- Keep one short README per project under `projects/` describing setup and quick run steps.
- Use file names like `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.pdf` for notes revisions.

Quick checklist
- Add short `notes/` entries for topics you study.
- Add solutions and code to `projects/` with a `README.md` for each project.
